  /*
    $dataToSelect:

    This array variable is used to specify what table columns have to be selected using a query.
    In case of ambiguous column names, make sure to specify the name of the table in front of the column name, like this:

    array(
      "tableName.coloumnName"
    )

    If you would like to use the AS keyword, you can achieve it by doing that:

    array(
      "columnName" => "customColumnName"
    )


    $tableName:

    This variable is used to store the table name from which we are going to select the specified columns.


    $joins

    This array variable is used to specify table joins. You have to use key => value type of arrays!

    array(
      "inner" => array("TableToJoin" => "Table1.Column1 = Table2.Column2", "OtherTableToJoin" => "Table3.Column3 = Table4.Column4"),
      "right" => array(), // Optional, if you don't want or need other joins than inner ones.
    )

    Key must always match the type of join you would like to create. It is not required to use all types of joins.
